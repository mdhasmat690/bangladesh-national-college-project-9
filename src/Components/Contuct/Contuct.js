import React from "react";
import { Card } from "react-bootstrap";

const Contuct = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>
        <Card.Body>
          <Card.Title>Developer is studying have a exam</Card.Title>
          <Card.Subtitle className="mb-2 text-muted">
            Cause her Raning have a exam
          </Card.Subtitle>
          <Card.Text>

          I could not complete the components because I had a test exam
            Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the
            bulk of the card's content.
          </Card.Text>
        </Card.Body>
      </Card>
    </div>

export default Contuct;
